Short description of the models:


These models cover different areas of NLP.

- key words:
model1:  Vector space model, term frequency–inverse, classification via k-NN

model2: Logistic Regresjon, 



- model1 consists of the following steps:

  -Pre-processing of given data
  
  -Vector space model to represent documents (bag-of-words) then  Visualizing them (matlibplot) 
  
  -term frequency–inverse(=tf-idf) for weighting the word vectors, the more informative word vectors the higher weight, 
  
  -classification via k-NN(k-nearest neighbors algorithm) for predicting which category the documents belong to. 
  
  -at the end, we test and  evaluate the model
  
 


- model2 consists of the following steps:

  -Logistic Regresjon for identifying which language a word belongs to via its phonetic features (transcriptions) 
    -training, predicting, evaluatiing, l Analysing of the model

  -Secquence models for association words to their phonetic features
  
    -Named Entity Recognition (=NER)
    
    -Hidden Markov Model (HMM) associating Each word with a particular class, 
      using so-called BIO annotation
