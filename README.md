THese models conver different areas of NLP.
key words:
model1:  Vector space model, term frequency–inverse, classification via k-NN
model2: Logistic Regresjon



model1 consists of the following steps:
  -Pre-processing of given data
  -Vector space model to represent documents (bag-of-words)
  then  Visualizing the data (matlibplot)
  classification 
  -term frequency–inverse(=tf-idf)  .. weighting of words, more informative words vectors have higer weights, 

  -classification via k-NN(k-nearest neighbors algorithm) for 

 


model2 consists of the following steps:

: Logistic Regresjon for identifying which language a word belongs to via its phonetic features (transcriptions)
